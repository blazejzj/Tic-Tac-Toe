# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe! This project is a simple, web-based implementation of the classic game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to create an interactive and user-friendly game experience that allows two players to compete and keep track of their scores.


### Features
- Player Names: Enter custom names for Player 1 ("O") and Player 2 ("X").
- Rounds: Set the number of rounds to play (1 to 10).
- Dynamic Scoreboard: Track scores for each player throughout the game.
- Responsive Design: Optimized for various screen sizes.
- Interactive Gameplay: Click on squares to make moves, and see the game board update in real-time.
- Win Detection: Automatically detects wins and displays the winner.


### How to Play
- Enter Player Names: In the left panel, input the names for Player 1 ("O") and Player 2 ("X"). You can skip this step to use default names.
- Set Rounds: Choose the number of rounds you want to play.
- Start Game: Click the "Start game" button to begin.
- Make Moves: Players take turns clicking on the game board to place their markers ("O" or "X").
- Win Detection: The game will automatically detect a win and update the score.
- Continue Playing: The game resets the board for the next round. The first player to reach the set number of rounds wins the game.
